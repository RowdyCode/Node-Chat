# Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built with **Node.js**, **Socket.io**, and **Express.js**. It allows users to log in with a username and password, chat with others, and send attachments (such as images, documents, etc.). The app stores user credentials in a `users.txt` file and chat history in a `chatHistory.txt` file.

## Developer
**RowdyCode**

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to serve static files and handle HTTP requests.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the front-end structure and styling of the chat interface.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side interactivity and communication with the server.
- **File System (fs)**: To read and write chat history and user credentials from files.

## Features

- User authentication with username and password.
- Real-time chat messaging.
- Ability to send text messages and attachments (images, PDF, text files, etc.).
- Chat history is saved to a `chatHistory.txt` file.
- User credentials are stored in a `users.txt` file.

## Node Packages

- **express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **socket.io**: A library for enabling real-time communication between the server and client.
- **fs**: Node.js's file system module for reading and writing files (used for storing user credentials and chat history).

## File Structure

```

  │   ├── index.html       # HTML file for the chat UI
  │   ├── script.js        # JavaScript for handling client-side logic
  │   └── styles.css       # CSS file for styling the chat app
  ├── users.txt            # Stores username and password pairs

  ├── server.js            # Node.js server for the chat app
  └── README.md            # Project README file
```

## File Structure Explanation

- **public/**: Contains the front-end files (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS).
- **users.txt**: Contains stored usernames and their corresponding passwords in JSON format.
- **chatHistory.txt**: Stores chat messages in a text format.
- **server.js**: The Node.js server file that handles user authentication, chat messages, and file transfers.

## How to Use

1. **Sign up or Log in**: When you first load the app, you will need to enter a username and password. If the credentials are valid, you will be allowed to enter the chat.
2. **Send a Message**: Once inside the chat, you can type messages and hit 'Send' to broadcast them to other users.
3. **Send Attachments**: Use the file input to upload an image, PDF, or other files. The file will be sent to the chat, and users will be able to see and download it.
